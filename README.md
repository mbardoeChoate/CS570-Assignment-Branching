# CS570-Assignment-1

In this assignment you will create a simple python program. The kind of program that is a typical starting point.
The goal will be to make a program that when run says "Hello, World". This should be the program on the `main` branch.
Then create another branch called `dev`. On this branch it should say "Hello, Dr. Bardoe". Be sure to commit and push 
each branch. Make good commit messages.


Be sure to push your work back to github. 

## Extension Idea

* Create two more branches. One called **`feature1`** and another **`feature1dev`**. Make 'feature1dev' starting from your 
  previous `dev` branch. Make a change to that, then branch off from there to make `feature1dev`. Make a change there and then
  use a pull request to merge that change back into feature1. Be sure to commit and push 
  each branch. Make good commit messages.
